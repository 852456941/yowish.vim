# Yowish, a yellowish dark vim colorscheme

## Description

Yowish is an [outlander-like](https://atom.io/themes/outlander-syntax) colorscheme for [Vim](http://vim.org) (Only GUI for the moment).

It should be good in any file type but his beauty is better shown in the following ones:

- `HTML` & `CSS`
- `SASS` & `SCSS`

- `Vim` & `vimhelp`
- `Markdown`

And have a specific theme for [airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline).

## Installation

Copy the distributed files into Vim runtime directory which is usually `~/.vim/`, or `$HOME/vimfiles` on Windows.

Or in a better way, use a vim plugin manager:

| Plugin manager                                         | In vimrc                         | Installation command |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)       | `Plug 'KabbAmine/yowish.vim'`      | `PlugInstall`          |
| [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)         | `Plugin 'KabbAmine/yowish.vim'`    | `PluginInstall`        |
| [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)   | `NeoBundle 'KabbAmine/yowish.vim'` | `NeoBundleInstall`     |

## Notes

Being the 1st vim colorscheme that I'm developing, feel free to report issues and PR.

And if you're asking yourself, yeah I like yellow color :smile:

## Todo

- Terminal support (256).
- Better support for `javascript`, `python`, `c` and `java`...
